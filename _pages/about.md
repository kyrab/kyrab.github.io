<p>Hi, my name is Kyra, pronounced like Keera (or Kira, or Keira, or...you get the gist). I am a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Statistics & Machine Learning as my primary major. I also had an additional major in Hispanic Studies and a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate about the intersection between data, technology, education, and language/culture.</p>
