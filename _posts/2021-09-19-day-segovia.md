## Introduction

Yesterday, I took a day trip to Segovia with three friends. This was the first excursion I have planned so far since arriving in Spain, so I really wanted to start off on a good note with respect to the destination and the planning. Unless my friends were lying to me, I think this was a success! Not that outside validation is always necessary, but it can be nice to have :).

From the moment I walked into the city center, I was in love. Segovia is quaint, rich in history/culture, and absolutely beautiful. I could not stop imagining how amazing life would be if I got to retire in a place like this. If you have the opportunity to make a pit stop at this city, you _must_.

## Itinerary

Below is the order in which my friends and I did things. We took a 10:15am train there and a 6:22pm train back. Time estimates are based on my experience.

30 minutes: _Ave_ train from the Madrid Chamartín train station to Segovia Guiomar.
- How amazing is it that they have trains that get there in half an hour?! Just be aware when booking your tickets because there is also a regional train that takes one hour and 40 minutes.

15 minutes: bus ride from the Segovia train station to the city center.
- When we went, it cost two euros per person, so having small bills and coins on hand is definitely recommended. Either bus (the 11 or 12) takes you to where you need to go; they end up only a few hundred meters away from each other.

1 hour: wander around the city center.
- Specific things to look out for: aqueducts (you really can't miss these), Casa de los Picos, Jewish Quarter, Iglesia de San Martín, Plaza Mayor.

1.5-2 hours: "independent exploration time".
- Depending on your interests, there are different places you can check out! For example, one of my friends went to the [Esteban Vicente Museum of Contemporary Art](https://www.museoestebanvicente.es/es/inicio/) and the [Colección de Titeres de Francsico Peralta](http://titeres.turismodesegovia.com/), while the rest of us went to the [Catedral de Segovia](https://catedralsegovia.es/) and the [Casa Museo de Antonio Machado](http://machado.turismodesegovia.com/es/casa-museo-de-antonio-machado). You could also walk one of the paths that give you an outside view of the Alcazar, such as the [Mirador de la Pradera de San Marcos](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187494-d2664523-Reviews-Mirador_de_la_Pradera_de_San_Marcos-Segovia_Province_of_Segovia_Castile_and_Leon.html). More on the Alcazar below.

1.5-2 hours: lunch.
- Apparently reservations are a must here for any good place! We went on a Saturday and pretty much no one would let us in without one, so we spent about a half hour looking around. This was the one unexpected surprise of our trip, since in Madrid you can generally find a place to eat without a reservation.
- If you can, try the _cochinillo_ (suckling pig), which Segovia is known for. I will note, though, that a lot of restaurants have these pigs on display in windows in their restaurant, so maybe keep your eyes up when walking down the streets that border Plaza Mayor if that makes you squeamish. Even though I am a carnivore, I still did not feel great passing by them.

1.5 hours: [Alcazar de Segovia](https://www.alcazardesegovia.com/).
- Buying tickets online ensures that you can enter at a specific time with pretty much no wait. We were able to reserve our time slot about four hours in advance, so it does not seem that you need to book days ahead or anything like that.
- In my humble opinion, spending the extra few euros to go up the _torre_ (tower) is absolutely worth it. The whole palace is stunning, but the views at the top are especially breath-taking. We went up during golden hour!

30 minutes: walk back from the Alcazar to where the buses depart from.
- We took a bit longer than what Maps predicts because we stopped at a bakery. My friend highly recommends trying the traditional Segovian dessert, _ponche_.

15 minutes: bus ride from the city center to the Segovia train station.
- Make sure you know the bus schedule ahead of time. They have it posted in the information center right by the aqueducts. If the timing does not work out, be prepared to hail a taxi the traditional way--none of our apps worked in Segovia.

30 minutes: _Ave_ train back to Madrid Chamartín.

## Closing Remarks

This is definitely a jam-packed, walking-heavy day, but the only time I was running or otherwise felt pressed for time was getting to my track in Madrid Chamartín! To avoid my situation, get to the train station 15-20 minutes before departure. Finding a place to eat without a reservation was also a tad demoralizing, but it did not delay our plans at all. Between the train tickets, food, and admission costs, I only spent 55 euros on the entire day. Best. First. Day. Trip. Ever. So, what are you waiting for? Grab some comfy shoes and hop on the next train to Segovia!
