<p>Hi, my name is Kyra, pronounced like Keera (or Kira, or Keira, or...you get the gist). I am a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Statistics & Machine Learning with an additional major in Hispanic Studies and a minor in Computer Science. Outside of the classroom, I served as the Head TA for CMU's introductory programming course and was involved with SWE (Society of Women Engineers). Given my background, it might be obvious that I am passionate about the intersection between data, technology, education, and language/culture :).</p>

<p>I am incredibly privileged to feel that the best way to build compassion and understanding on a global scale, as well as address my passions, is through travel. In this blog, I plan to share my own travel-related experiences so that I can help you prepare for your own adventures that lie ahead!</p>
