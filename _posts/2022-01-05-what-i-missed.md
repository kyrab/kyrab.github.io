Despite everything that is going on with Omicron right now, I was lucky enough to make it back to the States in time for the holidays. Over the course of that week, I noticed some random things that I had missed about the U.S.--or, to avoid being overly general, perhaps I should say my home in Connecticut. But on the flip side, I found myself missing small things about Madrid as well. So, I present to you a mini gratitude list for each. (It goes without saying that I of course missed my family and friends in either place!)

## Things I Missed About Connecticut

1. **Access to spice.** I am not by any means someone who has a high spice tolerance, but even the option to add a little kick to a meal is not very easy in Madrid. Example A: it took my friend and I multiple weeks to find a real chili powder in a grocery store, and I am pretty sure she ended up finding it in a small market in the "multicultural" neighborhood of Madrid, Lavapies. Example B: of the numerous Indian restaurants we have been to so far, all of the chicken tikka masalas are not just not spicy, but they are _sweet_.

2. **Soft tissues.** The softness of a Kleenex is unbeatable. And the fact that no one (I) would think that it was weird if they were asked "Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?" instead of "Hey, can you hand me a tissue?" goes to show how prevalent the brand is in the U.S. While boxes of Kleenex do exist in Spain, since it is an American brand, it is a little more expensive than I would like. As a result, I have tried to experiment with the generic brand stuff. So far, they have either had the texture of a cheap napkin or the texture of tissue paper...not ideal. It has me second-guessing whether generic brands back in the U.S. are closer to Kleenex or closer to the generic brands here.

3. **Winter/holiday feels.** I know they say nothing beats fall in New England, but winter in New England is pretty great too. The weather, the snow, the houses covered in string lights and with inflatable Santas in their front yards, the tree lighting ceremonies, and more all come together to create the most perfect holiday atmosphere.

4. **Bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches.** To me, a BEC on a fresh, fluffy roll = home. I have been eating them regularly since high school, when I would eat one every game day. (We would have team breakfasts instead of team pasta dinners like most people do because our practices would go so late, but that is a story for a different time.)

5. **American football.** It is so nice being able to spend all day Sunday watching football games. The ultimate lazy day. My family made a fantasy league to try and keep me in the loop while I have been abroad, but nothing compares to watching the games unfold live. Pulling an all-nighter to watch the Super Bowl, probably alone, is going to be a unique experience.

## Things I Missed About Madrid

1. **(Clean) public transportation.** Something that makes the United States unique is our intense desire for independence and autonomy, which is why I believe we have such an extensive road system but not so much an extensive rail system. While I understand the joy people get from driving, I personally prefer taking public transportation or other methods that do not require me to be at the wheel so that I have the ability to multitask. Madrid's public transportation system and its connections to other cities via bus and train are incredible. Stops and stations are conveniently located, reliable, clean, and also display clear messaging (such as minutes until arrival or departure). With regards to cleanliness, I am literally always seeing workers sweeping the metro stairs. I can't say I have ever seen someone do that in the NYC metro.

2. **Eating schedule.** Call me crazy, but I love eating dinner at 9 or 10pm. That, coupled with maybe one other activity (such as watching an episode of a TV show or showering) is a great way to wind down. Additionally, since the time between breakfast and lunch is pretty long, it gives me permission to feed my snack addiction.

3. **Feeling of freedom.** I really feel like I have a life out here, where I make decisions for myself and can function as an adult. While I think I would have felt this way to a degree anywhere I went post-college, I think living across the ocean on a completely different continent adds another layer of freedom. Keep in mind that I _did_ just watch Season 2 of _Emily in Paris_, so my perspective may be a little biased.

4. **Being surrounded by Spanish.** I think it is so important to be able to communicate with as many people as possible, but as someone who grew up only speaking English, picking up additional languages is not as easy for me. The only way I am able to progress is by being completely immersed in a society that speaks the target language. In Madrid, I learn something new about _castellano_ every day.

5. **Daily walks.** Going on a walk in Madrid is like a treasure hunt; you never know what you will stumble upon. For example, today I found a recently-opened playground complex, and last week I found that the holiday stalls were still open in Plaza de España and got myself some churros to go. Sometimes I'll stop inside a new café, _farmacia_ (pharmacy) or _alimentación_ (independently-owned snack shop similar to a gas station store) just to see how their offerings differ. (For context, there is usually one per block or two.) Also, even in the winter, the weather is mild and the sun feels as amazing as ever.

_¡Hasta la proxima!_
